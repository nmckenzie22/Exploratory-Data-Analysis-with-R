### Business Understandings
Goal: a wine producer has hired me to better understand what non-obvious factors affect wine quality

After some background research I have found that:
- Wine quality depends on chemical properties (like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol content) as well as human taste.
- Higher alcohol is typically associated with better quality wines.
- Too much residual sugar or acidity can negatively impact taste.
- Balance among components is important as extreme values might hurt quality.

Therefore, I will explore how each chemical property relates to wine quality. 

### Data Understandings
I will firstly load and inspect the datasets to get a better understanding of them.
```{r}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Read the data
red_wine <- read.csv("/Users/nickmckenzie/Downloads/wine+quality/winequality-red.csv", sep = ";")
white_wine <- read.csv("/Users/nickmckenzie/Downloads/wine+quality/winequality-white.csv", sep = ";")

# Quick look
glimpse(red_wine)
glimpse(white_wine)

# Dimension
cat("Red Wine: ", dim(red_wine)[1], "rows,", dim(red_wine)[2], "columns\n")
cat("White Wine: ", dim(white_wine)[1], "rows,", dim(white_wine)[2], "columns\n")

```
From the datasets we can find a lot of information. I have listed the key findings below:
##### Dataset info:
Red Wine: 1599 samples, 12 features
White Wine: 4898 samples, 12 features
